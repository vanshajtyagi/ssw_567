## What This Program Does

This program connects to GitHub's website and collects information about a user's code projects (called repositories). For each project, it counts how many times the user has saved their work (called commits). Think of it like counting how many times someone has saved a document while working on it.

The program was designed with **testing in mind first** - every feature was built to be easily testable and reliable.

## Quick Start Guide

### Step 1: Get the Code

Navigate to the project folder in your repository:

```bash
cd ssw_567/githubApi567_HW03a
```

### Step 2: Install Required Tools

Install the tools this program needs:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 3: Run the Program

Try it out with a simple test:

```python
from github_api import get_user_repos_with_commits

# Test with a GitHub username
user = "YOUR_USERNAME"
print(f'Fetched Repositories from Github for user: {user}')
print(f"Successfully retrieved {len(user_repos)} repositories")
```

## Example: What You'll See

When you run the program, it shows results like this:

```
Repo: Airline-Passenger-Satisfaction-Analysis Number of commits: 15
Repo: AWS-tutorials Number of commits: 8
Repo: Currency-Exchange-App Number of commits: 12

Summary:
    Total repositories: 3
    Total commits: 35
    Successfully analyzed all repositories
```

## How to Test the Program

Make sure everything works correctly by running these tests:

```bash
cd githubApi567_HW03a
python -m pytest test_github_api.py -v
```

This checks that all parts of the program work as expected. You should see "PASSED" next to each test.

For detailed testing with coverage:

```bash
pytest test_github_api.py -v --cov=github_api --cov-report=html
```

## Design Decisions and Testing Strategy

### What I Focused on When Writing This Code

**1. Easy Testing**
I designed the program with testing as the primary concern. Every function was built to be easily testable with clear inputs, outputs, and predictable behavior. It's like building with testing blocks - each piece can be tested independently.

**2. Handling Problems Gracefully**
The internet and APIs can be unreliable, so I made the program handle common problems:
- When a user doesn't exist on GitHub (404 errors)
- When GitHub limits how many requests we can make (rate limiting)
- When the internet connection is slow or fails
- When repository data is inaccessible (private repos)

**3. Clear Input Validation**
The function validates all inputs before processing:
- Checks for empty or invalid usernames
- Handles different data types appropriately
- Provides clear error messages for debugging

### Testing Challenges I Faced

**Challenge 1: Testing Without Hitting API Limits**
GitHub limits how many requests you can make per hour. To test my code without hitting this limit, I used "mock" objects that pretend to be GitHub but don't actually connect to the internet.

**Solution**: I used Python's `unittest.mock` to create fake HTTP responses that simulate GitHub's API without making real network calls.

**Challenge 2: Testing Error Scenarios**
I had to test what happens when things go wrong (like when a user doesn't exist or the network fails). Creating realistic error scenarios was challenging.

**Solution**: I created comprehensive mock scenarios for each type of error:
- HTTP 404 (user not found)
- HTTP 403 (rate limiting)
- Network timeouts and connection errors
- Malformed JSON responses

**Challenge 3: Testing Dynamic Data**
GitHub repository data changes constantly, making it hard to write consistent tests.

**Solution**: I used fixed mock data that represents realistic GitHub API responses, ensuring tests are reproducible and reliable.

### Why This Design Makes Testing Easier

1. **Single Responsibility Functions**: Each function does one thing, making it easy to test
2. **Clear Error Handling**: Specific exceptions for different error types
3. **Mockable Dependencies**: External API calls are easily replaced with mocks during testing  
4. **Structured Return Values**: Functions return consistent data structures that are easy to validate
5. **Input Validation**: Clear validation rules that can be tested independently
6. **Continuous Integration**: GitHub Actions automatically runs all tests on multiple platforms

The result is a program that's reliable, well-tested, and easy to modify or extend.

## Design and Testing Reflection

When designing this project, the main focus was making the code easy to test and maintain from day one. To achieve this, I structured the program so that each component has a clear, single responsibility - the main function handles API communication, input validation is separate, and error handling is explicit and testable.

Input validation was implemented early in the development process to catch errors before they propagate through the system. The function returns structured data (lists and dictionaries) instead of just printing output, making it straightforward to compare expected results with actual ones during testing. Additionally, I implemented comprehensive error handling for specific scenarios like invalid users, network problems, and API rate limiting, allowing tests to verify exact error conditions rather than generic failures.

Testing this project posed several unique challenges, primarily due to GitHub's API rate limits and the dynamic nature of repository data. GitHub restricts the number of requests that can be made per hour, so I used extensive mocking techniques that simulate API responses without making real network calls. This approach allows the test suite to run quickly and reliably without external dependencies.

Another significant challenge was handling the constantly changing nature of GitHub data - repositories are created, updated, and deleted frequently, and commit counts change as developers work. To address this, my tests focus on verifying data structure, types, and API interaction patterns rather than exact commit numbers. This ensures tests remain stable while still validating the core functionality.

The comprehensive test suite includes 15+ test cases covering:
- Valid user scenarios with various repository configurations
- Invalid input handling (None, empty strings, wrong data types)
- Network error scenarios (timeouts, connection failures)
- GitHub API specific errors (404, 403, rate limiting)
- Edge cases (users with no repositories, repositories with zero commits)
- Real GitHub API response structure validation

Through careful design decisions focusing on testability, clear error handling, and comprehensive test coverage, this project demonstrates how thinking like a tester from the beginning results in more robust, reliable, and maintainable code. The continuous integration pipeline further ensures that the code works consistently across different platforms and Python versions, providing confidence in its reliability and professional quality.
